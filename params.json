It featured \r\nsimple, functional-style syntax, and used colons to separate each command, and its \r\narguments. Now Derplang provides some syntactic sugar which makes it easier to use, while \r\nkeeping some core aspects of the language(like its name).\r\n\r\nWhy use it?\r\n-----------\r\nDerplang is simple, and fun. If you are used to languages such as C, C++, or Java, Derplang\r\nwill be a great introduction into the world of functional programming. Because it is\r\nsimple, it is easy and fast to pick up. Do you want to add another programming language to\r\nyour list? We thougt so. Derplang is also a fast growing community of people, and we hope\r\nto change the world with this project.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n* [Ruby 1.9.3](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)\r\n\r\nMore Coming Soon...","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
