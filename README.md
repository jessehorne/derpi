DerpC (Derplang Compiler)
=========================

This Derplang Compiler follows the 2.0 specification of Derplang.

What is Derplang?
-----------
Despite its name, Derplang is a serious, general purpose, programming language, inspired by
languages like Scheme, Python, Lua, etc. Derplang started out as an experiment to learn the 
inner workings of programming-language interpreters, as an esoteric langauge. It featured 
simple, functional-style syntax, and used colons to separate each command, and its 
arguments. Now Derplang provides some syntactic sugar which makes it easier to use, while 
keeping some core aspects of the language(like its name).

Why use it?
-----------
Derplang is simple, and fun. If you are used to languages such as C, C++, or Java, Derplang
will be a great introduction into the world of functional programming. Because it is
simple, it is easy and fast to pick up. Do you want to add another programming language to
your list? We thougt so. Derplang is also a fast growing community of people, and we hope
to change the world with this project.
